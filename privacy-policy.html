    <h2>Use License</h2>
    <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Recipe Saver's website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The materials on Recipe Saver's website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Recipe Saver makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights. Further, Recipe Saver does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.</p>
      
    <h2>Limitations</h2>
    <p>In no event shall Recipe Saver or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Recipe Saver's website, even if Recipe Saver or a Recipe Saver authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
    
    <h2>Accuracy of materials</h2>
    <p>The materials appearing on Recipe Saver's website could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. Recipe Saver does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. Recipe Saver may make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice. However Recipe Saver does not make any commitment to update the materials.</p>
    
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>Recipe Saver has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Recipe Saver of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.</p>
    
    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p>Recipe Saver may revise these terms of service for its website at any time without notice. By using this website you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Recipe Saver takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Services from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, email sent to or from the Services may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email. Please keep this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to Recipe Saver via the Internet.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>Recipe Saver does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through our site. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Data on the Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Recipe Saver through the site, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.</p>
    
    <h2>Special Provisions</h2>
    <p>User-posted content on Recipe Saver is not guaranteed to be stored, kept, or backed up for any length of time. By using this site you agree to allow Recipe Saver to modify or delete any content posted in your account at any time for any reason. We make no guarantee to the preservation of this data but will make reasonable efforts to notify you if such an event is ever anticipated. While paid accounts are entitled to "unlimited" recipe storage, this does not include cases where Recipe Saver deems the amount of recipes (or content contained within a single recipe) as excessive. A single recipe record containing over 100 kilobytes of data, or an account possessing over 5 megabytes of combined recipe records is deemed excessive and is grounds for deletion.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Texas and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that State or location.</p>

    <h1>Recipe Saver Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Recipe Saver's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. Accordingly, we have developed this privacy policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, disclose and otherwise make use of personal information. We have outlined our privacy policy below.</p>

    <h2>What data do we collect from you?</h2>
    <p>When you join Recipe Saver, we ask for information that will identify you as a user. This information includes your name, email address, and the time that you last logged into the site. Recipes that are posted to Recipe Saver from the user are saved in our database until deleted by the user or by Recipe Saver. Your anonymous information (i.e. not personal data), collected using cookies and web beacons, is shared with a third-party analytics company to provide us with information about how visitors use our sites. We use this information to help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, what products our users are interested in, and what kinds of services they like to see.</p>
    
    <h2>How do we use your personal data?</h2>
    <p>Your data is used for account management and service. Recipe Saver never supplies your personal information to any third party for advertising or promotional purposes. If you owe money to Recipe Saver and we are unable to collect it, we may need to give your contact information to a third party for collection purposes. We will occasionally use your email address to send you information regarding Recipe Saver and the services we provide.</p>
    
    <h2>Is my information secure?</h2>
    <p>Your personal information is protected by your password. Never share this password with anyone. We have taken steps to ensure our databases are secure, and are confident in our ability to keep your information safe.</p>
    
    <h2>How are cookies or localStorage used?</h2>
    <p>Recipe Savers stores cookie and localStorage objects on your computer to track you while you are on the site. The information in this cookie is a string of characters that is meaningless to everyone and everything except our server. No personal information or bid information is stored in the cookie. The information in the cookie can not be used by third parties to gain access to your account information.</p>
    
    <h2>How are payments handled?</h2>
    <p>We use a third party payment processor to process payments made to us. In connection with the processing of such payments, we do not retain any personally identifiable information or any financial information such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly to our third party processor, Stripe, whose use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy, which may be viewed at <a target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com/us/privacy">https://stripe.com/us/privacy</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Still have questions?</h2>
    <p>We realize everyone has a different view on privacy. We take your privacy very seriously. If you still have concerns, or are unclear about any aspect of our privacy policy, please contact us, and we will be happy to discuss the matter with you.</p>
    


    
    <p>We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of personal information is protected and maintained. Recipe Saver may change this privacy policy from time to time at Recipe Saver's sole discretion.</p>
